# Ultra Sonic Musical instrument

Remember/know Jean-Michel Jarre ? No ? [LMGIFY]

For his gigantic concerts, he had an instrument that emitted laser beams. Was it a harp, an organ. No idea.

Depending where he put his hands in the beam, the note would be different.

The setup described in this repo is less advanced.
No lasers **yet**

With four sensor, each can play two notes.

Hardware used :
 - Arduino Starter Kit
 - 4 HC-SR04 sensors
 - extra wires (w/ female connectors)
 - pins (found in starter kit)
 - jumpers


The notes are written to the serial console.
You have to write another program to read the console (COMx, /dev/ttyACMx) and play the corresponding notes.

Have fun. Hope it will amuse the kids in the workshops.
