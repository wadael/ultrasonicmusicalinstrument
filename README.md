Remember/know Jean-Michel Jarre ?

He had an instrument that emitted laser beams. Depending where he put his hands in the beam, the note would be different.

With four sensor, each can play two notes.

The notes are written to the serial console.
You have to write another program to read the console (COMx, /dev/ttyACMx) and play the corresponding note.

Have fun.
